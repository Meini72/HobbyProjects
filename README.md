# HobbyProjects
In this repository, there are some hobby projects done for online courses or platforms. They are implemented in Jupyter with Python 3, as well as some necessary libraries.<br><br>
•	A movie recommender system using collaborative filtering.<br>
•	A spam classifier using support vector machine (SVM).<br>
•	Recognition of handwritten digits by multi-class logistic regression.<br>
•	Image compression by K-means clustering algorithm.<br>
•	Data dimensionality reduction by PCA on face images.<br>
•	Detection of failing servers on a network by anomaly detection algorithm.<br>
• Support vector machine.

Some part of the code may refer to the following links for reference and hints. Thanks for the open-source wisdom. : )<br>
